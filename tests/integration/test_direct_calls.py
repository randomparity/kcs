"""
Integration test for direct function call extraction.

Tests the complete pipeline from C source code to extracted call graph data
for direct function calls, validating the integration of Tree-sitter parsing,
AST traversal, and database storage components.

This test focuses on the first quickstart scenario from the specification:
analyzing simple direct function calls in kernel code.

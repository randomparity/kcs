# Feature Specification: Infrastructure Core Components Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `005-infrastructure-empty-stub`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Infrastructure. Empty stub - no kernel config parsing, casues limited config-aware analysis, especially important for non x86 platforms.  drift_detector and report_generator modules commented out, results in No spec vs implementation validation.  Semantic search, call graph traversal not implemented, results in Limited query capabilities.  Graph serialization placeholder, path reconstruction missing, limits graph analysis features."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
   for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login
   system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the
   "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a kernel developer or system analyst using KCS, I need the system to provide comprehensive infrastructure capabilities including configuration-aware analysis for different platforms, specification validation, advanced search capabilities, and complete graph analysis features so that I can perform thorough kernel code analysis across different architectures and validate implementations against specifications.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a non-x86 kernel codebase (e.g., ARM64, RISC-V), **When** the user performs analysis queries, **Then** the system returns results that are aware of the specific platform configuration and build constraints

2. **Given** a kernel specification document and implementation code, **When** the user requests drift analysis, **Then** the system identifies discrepancies between specification and actual implementation

3. **Given** a complex query about kernel functions or symbols, **When** the user performs a semantic search, **Then** the system returns relevant results based on meaning and context rather than just keyword matching

4. **Given** a request for call graph analysis, **When** the user queries function relationships, **Then** the system traverses and returns the complete call graph with proper path reconstruction

5. **Given** a need to export or visualize graph data, **When** the user requests graph serialization, **Then** the system provides the graph in a usable format with all relationship paths preserved

### Edge Cases

- What happens when parsing a kernel configuration for an unsupported architecture?
- How does system handle specification documents with incomplete or ambiguous definitions?
- What occurs when semantic search encounters kernel-specific terminology not in the knowledge base?
- How does the system handle cyclic dependencies in call graph traversal?
- What happens when graph serialization encounters extremely large call graphs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST parse and interpret kernel configuration files for multiple architectures (x86, ARM64, RISC-V, PowerPC, etc.)

- **FR-002**: System MUST provide configuration-aware analysis that adjusts behavior based on the target platform's build constraints and features

- **FR-003**: System MUST validate kernel implementations against provided specifications and identify deviations

- **FR-004**: System MUST generate reports highlighting differences between documented behavior and actual code implementation

- **FR-005**: System MUST support semantic search capabilities that understand kernel concepts and terminology

- **FR-006**: System MUST traverse call graphs to show function relationships and dependencies

- **FR-007**: System MUST reconstruct complete paths through the call graph from entry points to target functions

- **FR-008**: System MUST serialize graph data in JSON Graph Format and GraphML

- **FR-009**: System MUST handle large-scale kernel codebases, in excess of 50,000 input files, on systems with no more that 16GB of RAM, and produce output files that can be handled with typical tooling such as jq (i.e. a 3GB JSON file is too large).

- **FR-010**: System MUST provide fallback behavior, allowing symbol/function/commit queries when config parsing fails or is unavailable.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Kernel Configuration**: Represents platform-specific build settings, enabled features, and architecture constraints for a kernel build

- **Specification Document**: Contains formal or informal descriptions of expected kernel behavior, interfaces, and constraints

- **Implementation Drift**: Represents detected differences between specified and actual behavior in the codebase

- **Semantic Query**: A search request that includes context, synonyms, and conceptual relationships beyond literal text matching

- **Call Graph**: A directed graph structure showing function calling relationships with nodes (functions) and edges (calls)

- **Graph Path**: A sequence of connected nodes representing a traversal through the call graph from source to destination

# Feature Specification: Implement MCP Tools

**Feature Branch**: `003-implement-mcp-tools`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement MCP tools in the current project.

- Location: src/python/kcs_mcp/tools.py
- Missing: All major tools return mock data
  - who_calls (line 253): Mock caller analysis
  - list_dependencies (line 300): Mock dependency analysis
  - entrypoint_flow (line 348): Mock flow tracing
  - impact_of (line 417): Mock impact analysis
- Impact: MCP API endpoints non-functional

Earlier project phases have done some layout work but are using mocks for testing. Need to
implement the actual code."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Extracted: Need to implement actual functionality for MCP tools
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: MCP tools, database integration, call graph traversal, impact analysis
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � All aspects clear from existing codebase
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flows determined from existing tests and mocks
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Based on existing mock implementations and database schema
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Call graphs, symbols, dependencies, impact analysis
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All requirements testable and clear
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a kernel developer using an AI coding assistant, I need to understand the relationships between
kernel functions, trace execution flows from system calls, and analyze the impact of code changes,
so that I can make informed decisions about kernel modifications and understand potential risks.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a kernel function name, **When** I query who calls it, **Then** I receive a complete
   list of direct and indirect callers with their source locations

2. **Given** a kernel function name, **When** I query its dependencies, **Then** I receive all
   functions it calls with their locations and call types

3. **Given** a system call entry point, **When** I trace its execution flow, **Then** I receive
   the step-by-step function call chain from syscall to implementation

4. **Given** a set of modified symbols or files, **When** I analyze impact, **Then** I receive
   affected configurations, modules, tests, owners, and risk assessment

5. **Given** any analysis query, **When** I request results, **Then** all responses include
   accurate file:line citations from the actual kernel source

### Edge Cases

- What happens when querying a non-existent symbol?
  � System returns empty results with appropriate status
- How does system handle circular call dependencies?
  � System uses depth limits and visited tracking to prevent infinite loops
- What happens when database has no call graph data?
  � System gracefully returns empty results without errors
- How does system handle very large call graphs?
  � System applies reasonable result limits to maintain
    performance

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide accurate caller information for any kernel symbol using
  actual call graph data
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide accurate callee information for any kernel symbol using
  actual call graph data
- **FR-003**: System MUST trace execution flow from kernel entry points through the call graph
- **FR-004**: System MUST analyze change impact by traversing call relationships bidirectionally
- **FR-005**: System MUST include accurate source code citations (file:line) for all results
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle depth-limited graph traversal to prevent performance issues
- **FR-007**: System MUST gracefully handle missing or incomplete call graph data
- **FR-008**: System MUST support configuration-specific call graph queries
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect and prevent infinite loops in circular call
  chains
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide risk assessment based on blast radius of changes

### Key Entities

- **Call Graph**: Directed graph of function call relationships with edge types
  (direct, indirect, macro)
- **Symbol**: Kernel function or variable with location information
- **Entry Point**: System call or other kernel boundary that initiates execution flows
- **Impact Analysis**: Assessment of change effects including affected subsystems,
  configurations, and risks
- **Citation**: Precise source location reference (file path, SHA, line range)

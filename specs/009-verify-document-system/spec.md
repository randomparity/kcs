# Feature Specification: Verify Document System

**Feature Branch**: `009-verify-document-system`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Verify Document System as Currently Implemented
**As a** developer **I want to** document the actual VectorStore API and database schema **So that** I can build on a verified foundation."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: What format should the VectorStore API and database documentation use? → A: Combined: OpenAPI for APIs + ERD diagrams for database
- Q: Which VectorStore implementation components should be documented? → A: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Q: When discrepancies are found between intended design and actual implementation, how should they be handled? → A: Document both intended and actual states
- Q: What level of detail should API endpoint documentation include? → A: OpenAPI spec with inline code samples
- Q: What aspects of the PostgreSQL pgvector schema should be documented? → A: Schema plus vector-specific configurations (dimensions, distance metrics)

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the document management system, I need accurate and complete documentation of the existing VectorStore implementation and its database schema so that I can understand the current state of the system and build new features or maintain existing ones with confidence.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer needs to understand the VectorStore system, **When** they access the documentation, **Then** they should find comprehensive documentation of all existing VectorStore API endpoints, their parameters, and responses
2. **Given** a developer needs to understand data persistence, **When** they review the documentation, **Then** they should find complete database schema documentation including all tables, fields, relationships, and constraints
3. **Given** a developer is debugging or extending the system, **When** they consult the documentation, **Then** they should be able to understand the purpose and usage of each component without examining source code

### Edge Cases

- When undocumented features are discovered, they MUST be documented with a "UNDOCUMENTED" warning label
- Deprecated or legacy components MUST be documented with clear "DEPRECATED" markers and migration notes
- Complex data relationships (>3 table joins) MUST include visual diagrams and example queries

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System documentation MUST include all existing VectorStore API endpoints with their complete signatures
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST describe the purpose and expected behavior of each API endpoint with inline code samples in OpenAPI specification
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST include all request parameters, their types, validation rules, and example values for each endpoint
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST specify all response formats, status codes, and error conditions for each endpoint
- **FR-005**: Database documentation MUST include all tables, columns, data types, constraints, vector dimensions, and distance metrics currently in use
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST describe relationships between database tables including foreign keys, associations, and vector index configurations
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST be verified against the actual implementation to ensure accuracy
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST identify and document both intended design and actual implementation when discrepancies are found
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST be formatted using OpenAPI specification for API endpoints and Entity Relationship Diagrams for database schema
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST cover PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension implementation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **VectorStore API**: The interface layer that provides operations for storing, retrieving, and searching vector embeddings
- **Database Schema**: The underlying data structure that persists vectors, metadata, and relationships
- **API Endpoint**: Individual operations exposed by the VectorStore including their inputs and outputs
- **Database Table**: Storage units within the database including their fields and relationships
- **Data Relationships**: Connections between different entities in the database schema

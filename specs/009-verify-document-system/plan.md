# Implementation Plan: Verify Document System

**Branch**: `009-verify-document-system` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: `/home/dave/src/kcs/specs/009-verify-document-system/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/dave/src/kcs/specs/009-verify-document-system/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Document and verify the actual VectorStore API implementation and PostgreSQL/pgvector database schema to establish a verified foundation for future development. This involves introspecting the current implementation, documenting all API endpoints with OpenAPI specifications, creating ERD diagrams for the database schema, and verifying vector configurations (384 dimensions) while ensuring multiple chunks per file are supported.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (based on async/await syntax in verification script)
**Primary Dependencies**: asyncpg, pgvector, pydantic (for data models)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
**Testing**: Python async testing with verification script provided
**Target Platform**: Linux server environment
**Project Type**: single - documentation/verification project
**Performance Goals**: N/A - documentation task
**Constraints**: Vector dimensions must be 384 (not 768), support multiple chunks per source file
**Scale/Scope**: Complete VectorStore API surface and database schema documentation

**User-Provided Acceptance Criteria**:

- List all actual VectorStore methods with signatures
- Document actual database column names and types
- Identify all unique constraints and indexes
- Verify vector dimensions (384, not 768)
- Map model fields to database columns exactly
- Test that multiple chunks per file are possible

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Read-Only Safety**: ✅ PASS - Documentation task is purely read-only, no code generation
**Citation-Based Truth**: ✅ PASS - All documentation will reference exact file/line locations
**MCP-First Interface**: ✅ PASS - Documentation outputs support MCP resource queries
**Configuration Awareness**: ⚠️ N/A - Not kernel analysis, but will document all configs
**Performance Boundaries**: ✅ PASS - Documentation generation has no performance impact

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Documentation and verification tools

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
For this verification and documentation feature, tasks will focus on:

1. Verification tasks from quickstart.md acceptance criteria
2. Documentation generation tasks for OpenAPI and ERD
3. Discrepancy resolution tasks from research findings
4. Test tasks to validate multiple chunks support

**Specific Task Categories**:

- Run verification script to confirm all acceptance criteria
- Generate OpenAPI documentation from vectorstore-api.yaml
- Create ERD diagrams from data-model.md
- Document discrepancies between migration and template schemas
- Test multiple chunks per file functionality
- Validate 384-dimensional vector configuration
- Map Python models to actual database columns

**Ordering Strategy**:

1. Verification tasks first (establish baseline)
2. Documentation generation tasks (parallel execution possible)
3. Discrepancy documentation tasks
4. Validation and testing tasks

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered tasks focusing on verification and documentation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Progress Tracking

*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)

# Feature Specification: Multi-File JSON Output Strategy

**Feature Branch**: `006-multi-file-json`
**Created**: 2025-01-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Multi-File JSON Output Strategy to address memory and processing issues with large kernel index files"

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extract: memory issues, processing bottlenecks, file size problems
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: indexing tools, database loader, system administrators
   ’ Actions: parse kernel, chunk output, process in parallel
   ’ Data: kernel symbols, entry points, call graphs
   ’ Constraints: 2.8GB file size, memory limits, processing timeouts
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Performance targets marked for clarification
   ’ Failure recovery specifics marked for clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flow: kernel indexing with manageable output files
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement made testable with specific thresholds
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Output chunks, manifest files, processing status
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN: Spec has performance target uncertainties
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a system administrator indexing Linux kernel source code, I need the indexing process to produce manageable output files that won't overwhelm system memory or cause processing failures, so that I can successfully populate the database with kernel analysis data without manual intervention or system crashes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a Linux kernel source tree with 70,000+ files, **When** running the indexing process, **Then** the output is split into multiple files each under 50MB
2. **Given** multiple output chunk files from indexing, **When** loading them into the database, **Then** each chunk processes independently without loading all data into memory
3. **Given** a failed database load at chunk 15 of 60, **When** restarting the process, **Then** processing resumes from chunk 15 without re-processing previous chunks
4. **Given** output organized by subsystem directories, **When** only the network subsystem changes, **Then** only the network chunks need re-processing

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a single kernel subsystem exceeds the chunk size limit?
- How does system handle corrupted or incomplete chunk files?
- What occurs when available disk space runs out during chunking?
- How does the system behave with simultaneous indexing of multiple kernel versions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST split large parsing output into files no larger than 50MB
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate a manifest file listing all output chunks with their metadata (size, checksum, subsystem, file count)
- **FR-003**: System MUST organize output files by kernel subsystem (fs/, net/, drivers/, arch/, etc.)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow parallel processing of multiple chunk files during database population
- **FR-005**: System MUST support resumable processing from specific chunk after failures
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to specify chunk size and parallelism level based on their system resources
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide progress tracking showing which chunks have been processed
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate chunk integrity before processing using checksums
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle incremental updates by only regenerating affected subsystem chunks
- **FR-010**: System MUST complete full kernel indexing within 30 minutes
- **FR-011**: System MUST limit memory usage per chunk to 5 times chunk size 
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear error messages identifying which chunk failed and why

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Output Chunk**: A single JSON file containing parsed kernel data from a subset of source files, limited in size, named with sequential numbering or subsystem identifier
- **Manifest File**: A metadata file listing all chunks, their order, checksums, subsystems covered, and processing status
- **Processing Status**: Track record of which chunks have been successfully loaded into database, failed, or are pending
- **Subsystem Grouping**: Logical organization of kernel source (e.g., filesystem, networking, drivers) used to partition output

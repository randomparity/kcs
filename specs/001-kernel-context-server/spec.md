## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a kernel developer or AI coding assistant, I need to understand the Linux kernel's structure, dependencies, and impact of code changes so that I can safely propose, review, and implement changes without introducing unexpected breakages or violating kernel constraints.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a kernel developer new to a subsystem, **When** they query how a specific system call flows through the kernel, **Then** they receive a complete flow diagram with entry points, function calls, locks/RCU usage, and relevant test coverage with exact file/line citations.

2. **Given** an AI agent proposing a kernel code change, **When** it queries the impact of modifying a specific function, **Then** it receives a blast radius report showing affected configurations, modules, tests, maintainers, and risk flags.

3. **Given** a maintainer reviewing a pull request, **When** they check for spec drift, **Then** they receive a report showing any mismatches between ABI documentation, Kconfig options, test coverage, and the actual implementation.

4. **Given** a CI system processing a kernel PR, **When** it requests impact analysis, **Then** it receives a targeted list of configurations to build, modules to test, and maintainers to notify, reducing CI time while maintaining quality.

5. **Given** a developer adding a new kernel feature, **When** they check spec compliance, **Then** they receive actionable feedback about missing ABI documentation, test coverage gaps, or Kconfig inconsistencies.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when querying symbols that exist only in specific kernel configurations?
- How does system handle indirect function calls through function pointers and vtables?
- What occurs when runtime behavior differs significantly from static analysis?
- How are macro-heavy code sections analyzed where preprocessor expansion is critical?
- What happens when multiple concurrent changes affect overlapping kernel areas?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST parse Linux kernel repository into queryable graphs containing files, symbols, call relationships, entry points, and configuration dependencies
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract and identify all kernel entry points including syscalls, ioctl handlers, netlink operations, file operations, sysfs/proc/debugfs attributes, driver callbacks, and BPF attach points
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain dependency-aware summaries for each symbol including purpose, inputs/outputs, side effects, concurrency constraints, and error handling paths
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide read-only access to kernel graphs, summaries, documentation, tests, and ownership information through Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support querying for symbol information, call graphs, dependency trees, entry point flows, and impact analysis with file/line citations
- **FR-006**: System MUST tag all edges and symbols with their configuration context supporting x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures and multiple build configurations
- **FR-007**: System MUST compute impact analysis showing affected configurations, modules, tests, owners, and risk flags for any given code change
- **FR-008**: System MUST detect drift between forward specifications (ABI docs, Kconfig, tests) and actual implementation
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with CI systems to provide targeted build/test subsets and drift reports for pull requests
- **FR-010**: System MUST achieve index creation within 20 minutes for a full kernel tree and 3 minutes for incremental updates
- **FR-011**: System MUST resolve at least 90% of first-hop static edges for modified files in pull requests
- **FR-012**: System MUST respond to MCP queries with p95 latency under 600ms for standard lookups
- **FR-013**: System MUST operate in read-only mode without code generation or repository modification capabilities
- **FR-014**: System MUST redact sensitive information from logs and provide secure access control
- **FR-015**: System MUST emit observability metrics including index time, edge counts, coverage percentages, and API call volumes
- **FR-016**: System MAY support optional dynamic tracing via ftrace/eBPF to confirm runtime edges (callers/callees, vtables, notifiers) for changed symbols under targeted tests in future enhancements
- **FR-017**: System MUST support at least 2 configurations per architecture with graph storage under 20GB
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide ownership information based on MAINTAINERS file with longest-prefix path matching
- **FR-019**: System MUST decode ioctl commands with at least 95% accuracy including _IO* macro expansions
- **FR-020**: System MUST block merges when drift detection identifies any ABI or Kconfig contract change/removal or missing required tests for modified entry points; otherwise post warnings and open follow-up tasks without blocking

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Kernel Symbol**: Represents functions, structures, and variables in the kernel with their location, type, configuration context, and relationships
- **Entry Point**: Kernel boundary where external requests enter (syscalls, ioctls, proc/sysfs, drivers) with associated handlers and dispatch logic
- **Configuration Set**: Build configuration that determines which symbols and features are compiled into the kernel
- **Call Graph Edge**: Relationship between caller and callee functions including configuration context and call type
- **Impact Analysis Result**: Computed blast radius showing affected subsystems, tests, owners, and risk factors for a change
- **Drift Report**: Comparison between specified behavior (docs/tests) and actual implementation with actionable discrepancies
- **Summary**: Synthesized knowledge about a symbol or flow including purpose, constraints, side effects, and concurrency requirements
- **Citation**: Exact file path and line number reference providing traceability for any claim or finding
- **Module**: Loadable kernel module with its symbols, dependencies, and autoload aliases
- **Test Coverage**: Mapping between kernel code and KUnit/kselftest coverage with execution requirements

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality

### Open Questions Requiring Clarification

1. **Architecture Support**: Is x86_64 the only required architecture for v1, or must arm64 also be supported?
2. **Drift Enforcement**: Should drift detection failures block CI merges or only generate warnings/tasks?
3. **Dynamic Tracing**: Is runtime tracing via ftrace/eBPF required for v1 or deferred to future phases?
4. **MCP SLOs**: What are the specific latency requirements under various load conditions?
5. **ABI Surfaces**: Which kernel ABI surfaces (sysfs, proc, debugfs, netlink, ioctls) must be modeled in v1?

# Feature Specification: Semantic Search Engine (kcs-search)

**Feature Branch**: `008-semantic-search-engine`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Semantic Search Engine (kcs-search). Integrate embedding model (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5). Implement pgvector operations. Add query preprocessing and result ranking. Connect to MCP search endpoints."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
   for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login
   system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the
   "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a kernel researcher or security analyst, I need to search through large amounts of kernel source code and documentation using natural language queries to find relevant functions, vulnerabilities, and code patterns without needing to know exact function names or precise technical terminology.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a large kernel codebase indexed in the system, **When** a user submits a natural language query like "memory allocation functions that can fail", **Then** the system returns ranked results showing relevant functions like kmalloc, vmalloc, and related code with confidence scores
2. **Given** indexed kernel documentation and source code, **When** a user searches for "buffer overflow vulnerabilities in network drivers", **Then** the system returns semantically relevant code sections and documentation with explanatory context
3. **Given** the search system is connected to MCP endpoints, **When** a user performs a search, **Then** the results are accessible through the standardized MCP interface for integration with other tools
4. **Given** a user submits a query with common typos or alternative terminology, **When** the query is processed, **Then** the system still returns relevant results through semantic understanding rather than exact keyword matching

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a query returns no semantically relevant results above the confidence threshold?
- How does the system handle queries in languages other than English?
- What occurs when the vector database is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does the system behave with extremely long or malformed queries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language search queries and return semantically relevant results from kernel source code and documentation
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate vector embeddings for text content using semantic understanding rather than simple keyword matching
- **FR-003**: System MUST rank search results by semantic relevance and provide confidence scores for each result
- **FR-004**: System MUST preprocess queries to improve search accuracy through normalization and enhancement techniques
- **FR-005**: System MUST store and retrieve vector embeddings efficiently for large-scale kernel codebases
- **FR-006**: System MUST expose search functionality through MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoints for integration with other analysis tools
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle concurrent search requests from multiple users or automated systems
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide contextual information with search results including file paths, line numbers, and surrounding code context
- **FR-009**: System MUST support indexing of both source code files and documentation with appropriate content type handling
- **FR-010**: System MUST support optional use of authentication tokens for API access
- **FR-011**: System MUST support at least 10 concurrent user requests
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain vector embeddings for 1 year, anonymized search analytics for 90 days, and raw search queries for 7 days

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Search Query**: User-submitted natural language text that describes what they want to find in the kernel codebase
- **Vector Embedding**: Numerical representation of text content that captures semantic meaning for similarity comparison
- **Search Result**: Individual item returned from a search containing the matched content, file location, confidence score, and contextual information
- **Indexed Content**: Source code files, documentation, and other text that has been processed and stored in vector form for searching
- **MCP Endpoint**: Standardized interface that exposes search functionality to external tools and clients
- **Confidence Score**: Numerical metric indicating how well a search result matches the user's query semantically

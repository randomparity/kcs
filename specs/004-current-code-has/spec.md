# Feature Specification: Enhanced Kernel Entry Point and Symbol Detection

**Feature Branch**: `004-current-code-has`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Current code has important missing features.
Only syscalls implemented, missing ioctls, file_ops, sysfs, etc. Limited
kernel-specific pattern recognition, no EXPORT_SYMBOL, module_param detection.
Clang index not initialized, symbol enhancement missing. Add these important
kernel-specific features."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identify missing kernel features: ioctls, file_ops, sysfs entry points
   � Identify missing pattern recognition: EXPORT_SYMBOL, module_param
   � Identify missing enhancements: Clang index, symbol enrichment
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Kernel developers, AI assistants using KCS
   � Actions: Query kernel entry points, analyze symbol relationships
   � Data: Kernel source code, entry point definitions, symbol metadata
   � Constraints: Must support all major kernel interfaces
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � All kernel-specific patterns clearly identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Users need comprehensive kernel interface analysis
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement tied to specific kernel pattern
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Entry points, symbols, kernel patterns
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All requirements testable and clear
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a kernel developer or AI assistant analyzing kernel code, I need to
discover and analyze all types of kernel entry points and exported symbols,
not just syscalls, so that I can understand the complete interface surface
of the kernel and track dependencies accurately.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a kernel codebase with ioctl handlers, **When** searching for
   entry points, **Then** all ioctl command handlers are detected and properly
   categorized
2. **Given** a kernel module with file operations structures, **When**
   analyzing entry points, **Then** all file_ops functions (read, write, open,
   etc.) are identified as entry points
3. **Given** a driver with sysfs attributes, **When** querying interfaces,
   **Then** all sysfs show/store handlers are recognized as entry points
4. **Given** kernel functions marked with EXPORT_SYMBOL, **When** analyzing
   symbols, **Then** exported symbols are marked with their visibility level
   (GPL, non-GPL)
5. **Given** modules with parameters, **When** examining configuration options,
   **Then** all module_param declarations are detected and associated with
   their modules
6. **Given** enriched symbol data from multiple sources, **When** querying a
   symbol, **Then** complete metadata including type information and
   documentation is provided

### Edge Cases

- What happens when ioctl commands use magic numbers vs named constants?
- How does system handle dynamically registered entry points (e.g., runtime sysfs creation)?
- What happens when EXPORT_SYMBOL is used with preprocessor conditionals?
- How does system handle file_ops structures that are partially populated?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect ioctl entry points including command
  definitions and handler functions
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify file operations structures (file_ops,
  block_device_operations, etc.) and their function pointers as entry points
- **FR-003**: System MUST recognize sysfs attributes (DEVICE_ATTR, CLASS_ATTR,
  etc.) and their show/store handlers
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect procfs entry points created via proc_create and related APIs
- **FR-005**: System MUST identify debugfs entry points and their associated operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect netlink handlers and their message
  processing functions
- **FR-007**: System MUST recognize EXPORT_SYMBOL, EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, and
  EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS declarations
- **FR-008**: System MUST identify module_param, module_param_array, and
  related parameter declarations
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect kernel notification chains and their callback registrations
- **FR-010**: System MUST identify interrupt handlers and their registration points
- **FR-011**: System MUST enrich symbols with type information when semantic
  analysis is available
- **FR-012**: System MUST preserve and expose kernel-specific metadata (GPL
  restrictions, module ownership, etc.)
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle architecture-specific entry points
  (arch-specific syscalls, platform drivers)
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain relationships between entry points and their implementing modules

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Entry Point**: A kernel boundary where external interaction occurs
  (syscall, ioctl, file_ops, sysfs, procfs, debugfs, netlink)
- **Exported Symbol**: A kernel function or variable made available to modules
  via EXPORT_SYMBOL variants
- **Module Parameter**: A configurable value exposed by a kernel module via
  module_param
- **Symbol Metadata**: Enhanced information about symbols including type
  signatures, documentation, export status
- **Interface Pattern**: A recognizable code pattern that defines a kernel
  interface (e.g., file_operations struct)

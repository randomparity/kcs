## ¡ Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
   for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login
   system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the
   "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a kernel developer or AI coding assistant analyzing Linux kernel code, I need to understand comprehensive function call relationships including direct calls, function pointers, macro expansions, and indirect calls so that I can trace complete code execution paths, analyze the impact of changes, and understand system dependencies across large kernel codebases efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a kernel source file with direct function calls, **When** I analyze the code, **Then** I receive accurate call relationships with file and line citations for all direct function invocations

2. **Given** kernel code using function pointers and callbacks, **When** I analyze call relationships, **Then** I can trace indirect call patterns and understand callback mechanisms

3. **Given** kernel code with macro-based function calls, **When** I extract call graphs, **Then** I can see through macro expansions to identify the actual function relationships

4. **Given** a large kernel codebase (50,000+ files), **When** I perform call graph extraction, **Then** the analysis completes within performance requirements and provides complete relationship data

5. **Given** kernel code with conditional compilation blocks, **When** I analyze calls, **Then** I understand which calls are active under specific configuration settings

6. **Given** complex kernel subsystems with multiple indirection levels, **When** I trace call paths, **Then** I can follow the complete execution flow from entry points to implementation functions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when function calls are made through deeply nested function pointer structures?
- How does the system handle macro calls that expand to multiple function invocations?
- What about calls in assembly inline blocks or architecture-specific code?
- How are calls handled when they cross compilation unit boundaries?
- What happens with recursive function calls or circular dependencies?
- How does the system handle calls through virtual function tables or jump tables?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST extract direct function call relationships from C source code with complete accuracy for standard function invocation patterns

- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and track function pointer assignments and their subsequent invocations to understand indirect call patterns

- **FR-003**: System MUST expand and analyze macro-based function calls to reveal the actual underlying function relationships

- **FR-004**: System MUST handle callback registration patterns common in kernel code (e.g., file_operations, device drivers, interrupt handlers)

- **FR-005**: System MUST provide call relationship data that includes precise source location citations (file path, line number, column)

- **FR-006**: System MUST analyze call relationships within conditional compilation blocks and associate them with appropriate kernel configuration dependencies

- **FR-007**: System MUST complete call graph extraction for large kernel codebases (50,000+ source files) within 20 minutes on standard development hardware

- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate with existing Tree-sitter AST parsing infrastructure without breaking current symbol extraction capabilities

- **FR-009**: System MUST distinguish between different types of calls (direct, indirect, macro, callback) and provide this classification in the call graph data

- **FR-010**: System MUST handle cross-file function calls and maintain relationships between symbols across compilation units

- **FR-011**: System MUST provide call depth analysis to understand layering and abstraction levels in kernel code

- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to query call relationships through MCP protocol endpoints with sub-second response times for typical queries

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **CallEdge**: Represents a function call relationship with caller function, callee function, call site location, call type classification, and conditional compilation context

- **Function**: Represents a callable entity in kernel code with name, signature, file location, symbol type, and associated call relationships (both incoming and outgoing)

- **CallSite**: Represents the specific location where a function call occurs, including file path, line number, column number, and surrounding context

- **MacroCall**: Represents function calls that occur through macro expansion, maintaining the link between macro usage and actual function invocation

- **FunctionPointer**: Represents function pointer assignments and their usage patterns, enabling indirect call analysis

- **CallPath**: Represents a sequence of function calls from an entry point to a target function, enabling complete execution flow analysis
